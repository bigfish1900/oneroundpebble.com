The Nurse gave him some Medazolam. Basically, it zonks them out and makes them forget (although it can sometimes make kids a bit hypo). </p> <p>It put James into a really good mood and he was nice and relaxed when they took out the drains in his chest.</p> <p>He and Lyds had great fun playing with bubbles while the nurses did the work.</p> <p>Afterwards he started to act like a drunk. Guess that was a bit of an insite to James in 20 years time [:P]</p> <p mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.
