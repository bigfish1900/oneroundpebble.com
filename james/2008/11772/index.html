The operation went as the surgeon had hoped. </p> <p>He patched the hole (a &lt;A class="" title=VSD href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect" target=_blank mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"&gt;VSD), repaired the &lt;A class="" title="Aortic Arch" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch" target=_blank mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"&gt;Aortic Arch&nbsp;and completed an enlargement of the left ventricular outflow track (LVOT).</p> <p>Seeing the little guy wired up to what seemed like every device known to medical science was terrible. I'll try and upload a photo sometime soon, but basically every bit of James seemed to have something attached. </p> <p>&nbsp;There is a central line into the neck, the breathing and feeding tubes into his nose, a tube into the mouth (not sure what it's for) a line into his right arm for BP and bloods, a line into the left arm, stuff hanging off the legs and worst of all is the open chest. </p> <p>The surgeon decided to leave it open. This means that there is a half centimetre hole running down his sternum which has been covered with a clear plastic. Not pretty.</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.
