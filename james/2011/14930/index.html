We where pretty happy, only 24 hours in Intensive Care after major heart surgery.</p> <p>&nbsp;I stayed with James last night and he had a pretty good night. </p> <p>He did manage to pull both of his drainage tubes off when he rolled over, but luckly the nurse was right beside the bed and clamped both of them before it had leaked anywhere or got any air bubbles into his chest cavity.</p> <p>We woke a couple more times, but overal was a pretty good night.</p> <p>Today wasn't quite so good though. James was grumpy all day (I can totally understand it) which made for a pretty long day for everyone.The poor little guy was feeling pretty average this afternoon and was bringing everything back up. </p> <p>He's had some meds to try and settle his stomach now, so hopefully he'll be on top of that tomorrow.</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.
