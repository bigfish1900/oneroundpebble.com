While they where doing that they had to help him with his heart functions.</p> <p>This means that he now has even more leads running out of his body. Hopefully this will give his little heart a bit of time to recover from the surgury. The current plan is to keep him sedated and try an move him back to using his own heart sometime tomorrow.</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.
